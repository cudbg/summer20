### <a name="pi"/> Precision Interfaces

* [SIGMOD 2019 full paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9i0pbkacqpb5s0r/precisioninterface-sigmod19-cr.pdf?dl=0):  This paper describes the original vision and method of modeling interfaces as abstract syntax trees.  Sections 1-4 are useful to understand. The algorithms described in sectons 5 and 6 have changed since then.
* [IPA 2020 workshop paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/09ri46n9zcv7jxh/precisioninterface-ipa20-submitted.pdf?dl=0): This paper introduces the concept of a diff tree and its mapping to an interface layout and widget.  It is a good summary of how precision interfaces works today.   It's main limitation is that it only supports a single visualization chart -- it cannot generate interfaces containing multiple chart views (in interface specification parlance)
